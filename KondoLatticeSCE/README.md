     KondoLatticeSCE - Phase diagram calculation code
  ------------------------------------------------------

A suite in C for Kondo lattice model calculations in 3 dimensions. Can be used to produce a diagram for normal paramagnetic, Kondo paramagnetic, and magnetically-ordered phases.

It may be of interest to you if...

- You're trying to run calculations in parallel on a desktop computer. If so, see the sm.h and sm.c files.
- You're a physicist with scholarly interest/concern and you wish to see the code used to produce the data in a certain thesis. Please contact me if this is the case.
