o  Have your pick of some of my more presentable scripts and code, made over the years as I fumbled toward a thesis.
o  No, there is no one specific programming/scripting language in this repository.
o  Nothing will, foreseeably, be revisited once added to this repository. Wysiwyg. As-is. Use at your own risk. =P
o  Most scripts are tools independent of other files, and have been commented accordingly. Seasoned coders and scientists will likely find nothing useful here. This stuff is for the frustrated beginner and/or the new grad student.
